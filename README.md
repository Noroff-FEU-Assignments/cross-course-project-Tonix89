## Description

RainyDays website is my cross course project in the first semester of my front-end development course at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media. In our second semester, JavaScript was added in this project. RainyDays is an online store for rain jackets.

## Project Brief

You need to deliver a properly functioning, responsive website for the assignment brief that you chose in Design 1.

  - The HTML should be semantic and neat.
  - The CSS should follow the DRY principle and be easy to read.
  - The website should be responsive and look good at every screen size with no horizontal scrollbars. Use Flexbox and CSS Grids where appropriate. Please do not use a     CSS framework like Bootstrap, we want to see that you can build responsive sites without the help of a framework.
  - The site should be WCAG compliant and accessibility taken into account.
  - Each page should have a unique meta description, title, and h1.
  - You should not use copied code in your submission. All code submitted must be written by you. You may use external sources to show you how to achieve specific         effects, and these should be included in your report.
  - Using API to populate product list.
  - Validate contact form using JavaScript.
  - Specific page for specific item/product.
